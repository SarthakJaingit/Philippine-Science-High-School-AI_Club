# Philippine-Science-High-School-AI_Club
* All the files on the AI club (PSHS)
* Email jainsarthak101@gmail.com for questions

* Beginning Audio Recordings are about Deep Learning Theory
* Later on is about code.

The audio files are just demo files to our first meetings
Also coding files are not updated regularly in order to get access to up to date material it is better to contact me or join the club.

## Most of the recordings are not posted here since github can't store many 100 MB video files. For full zoom recordings with video please email me.
